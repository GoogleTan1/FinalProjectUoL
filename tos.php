The terms written in this page applies automatically to all users upon the creation of any accounts and/or interactions with services associated with Project FundMe, and you will verify agreement to all the terms upon interaction of this web application. We reserve the right to block you from any and all services for any reason, including, but not limited to, breach of any terms written. These terms are not a form of user oppression, but a standard to create a fair environment for all users of any or all of our services. Terms of Service will change from time to time. It is your duty as a user to review the Terms of Service whenever necessary. <br><br>
              
          From herein, these terms will and shall be used within the Terms of Service (ToS). The Terms of Service may be referred to as "ToS". Members of Public shall be referred to as "Users" or "Members of Public", Organisers shall be referred to as "Organisers" and Project FundMe staffs shall be referred to as "we, our, or the staff".
          <br><br>
              
          We reserve the right to deny you access to Project FundMe at any point of time.<br><br> 
          </p>
      
          <h2>General Rules</h2>
          <p>
              <b><u>1.1. RESPECT</u></b><br>
<p>
Discriminating against any other members, staff or organisers based on race, religion, sexual orientation or age will not be tolerated. Respect is a large topic and is handled on a case-by-case basis. Being uncertain if your message may come across as abusive/rule-breaking, we advise against posting such messages on ANY platform at all. While we exercise freedom of speech, excessive use of profanity is still liable to punishment. This rule is inclusive of offensive usernames used during account creation. Please note that no warnings shall be given out for serious matters such as gender discrimination, racial slurs, offensive jokes, offensive usernames, abusive messages, and/or deemed fit by us. Actions will be carried out as verbal warnings, we will not hesitate to take further action upon any individuals that disrespect other individuals. Any attempt at doing so will be reported to the relavant authorities.<br><br>  
</p>
      
 
      <p>
<b><u>1.2. HARASSMENT</u></b><br>
Harassment of any form shall not be welcomed within any service of Project FundMe. This includes; but not limited to, usage of racial/homophobic slurs, slander, libel, name-calling, deliberate hostility towards other users, organisers or staffs, flaming, trolling, profanity, defamation, and deliberately causing stress to other users. Harassment is handled on a case-by-case basis by us. Actions pertaining to 'doxing' or the publication of private and personal information of any users of the web application will not be tolerated. Any acts of doxing will result in a permanent suspension from all our services. Attempting to ruin the experience for other users on any of our services will not be TOLERATED AT ALL.  <br><br> 
</p>
    

      
<b><u>1.3. ADVERTISEMENT</u></b><br>
      <p>
Advertising another network, organisations appeal, phishing, scamming websites, Discord server, social media platforms (regardless of whether or not you own the account), and any cause that you stand to benefit from is strictly forbidden. <br><br>

</p>
 
      
      
<b><u>1.4. IMPERSONATION</u></b><br>
      <p>
Impersonation of any sort is strictly forbidden, this includes staff impersonation and government impersonation. You shall only appear as yourself, and no one else. Regardless of the available service, any attempt at impersonation will result in the user being severely dealt with. To clarify, informing users of rules and other useful information is allowed, but lying about being part of the staff is NOT. Claiming you have the authority to punish another user on any service falls under this. Usernames with the rearrangement of alphabetical and numerical characters and/or the substitution of characters to retain a similar representation of a Staff member's name will also be classified as Impersonation. Any attempt at doing so will be reported to the relavant authorities.<br><br>
